## Portfolio (HTML + CSS Project)

This is my **first-ever independent project** as well as my **first portfolio**. It showcases my current HTML and CSS skills in a clean and minimal layout.

### What I Learned

* Using **linear-gradient overlays** on background images
* Managing **spacing** with `height`, `width`, `vh`, `vw`, and `%`
* Applying **independent CSS styling** without frameworks
* Controlling **box shadows** for depth
* Using `object-fit: cover` for image handling
* Avoiding layout bugs like **horizontal scrollbars**
